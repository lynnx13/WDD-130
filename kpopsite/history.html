                <strong>The History of K-Pop</strong>
                <br>
            <br>
            The origins of Korean popular music can be found in the year 1885, but 'K-pop' at that time primarily consisted of Korean translations of American songs. The majority of the songs are suitable for dancing because they have a strong sense of rhythm and are reasonably fast-paced. When they perform, they frequently sing and dance, and the choreography urbanance is a key element in appeal. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Hip hop, rock, jazz, and electronic dance were among the American and partially European popular music genres that Korean pop artists incorporated into their music in the 1990s. The emergence of Seo Taiji & Boys in 1992 was a turning point in K-pop history. When the trio first debuted on a music show, they were scored the lowest out of all the performers. However, their songs would go on to earn attention from the public, and pave the way for similar songs and albums. <br>

            <strong>The Rise of Modern K-Pop</strong>
        <br>
        The rise of entertainment companies in K-pop signified the beginning of the industry. The entertainment business SM Entertainment was established in 1995 by South Korean record producer Lee Soo-man, who was educated in the US and exposed to the trends in American music. Yang Hyun-suk, a former member of Seo Taiji & Boys, founded YG Entertainment in 1996, and Park Jin-young founded JYP Entertainment in 1997.

        The huge popularity of Seo Taiji & Boys among teenagers shifted the focus of the Korean music industry to teen-centred pop music. Idol bands of young boys or girls were formed to cater to a growing teenage audience. Since the mid-2000s, a huge portion of the East Asian music market has been dominated by K-pop.<br>

        <br>
        The genre has experienced quick growth elsewhere in the world, particularly since Psy's "Gangnam Style" music video became the first YouTube video to receive one billion views and received extensive media attention. BoA, Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation, and CL are a few examples of entertainment companies that have tried and failed to penetrate the English-language market. The 2017 Billboard Music Awards saw BTS receive Top Social Artist, making them the first K-pop act to do so. The single "DNA" peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 as a result of their performance of it at the American Music Awards, the first AMA appearance by a K-pop group. The following year, BTS became the first K-pop group to reach number 1 on the Billboard 200 with Love Yourself: Tear.
