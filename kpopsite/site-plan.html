      <p>
        <strong>Why people come to my site</strong>
        <br>
        People will come to my website for a condensed information database on many different groups in the k-pop genre. I will also include information regarding how k-pop got started, so that people with all levels of knowledge feel welcomed.<br>
        <strong>What questions my visitors expect to be answered</strong>
        <br>
        Visitors to my site will be able to find the answer to any kind of questions related to popular kpop groups or kpop in general. For example, I plan on featuring information on popular groups, including their discography, members, and information about their agency and debut. I also plan to have an area of information on basic genre facts such as terms commonly used and big agencies.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What type of activities can visitors complete?</strong>
        <br>
        In terms of activities, people come mainly for information as it is a database of sorts. However, I will include a "if you like this group you might also like_" feature. To help people learn about other groups and to relate kpop back to english and americanized songs.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>What information is necessary?</strong>
        <br>
        For one, basic information and understanding towards kpop is required, I would need to know enough information about it to teach others. However, as a visitor there is no level of knowledge needed. As I mentioned before, the site is made with beginners in mind.<br>
<br>
        <strong>Why will visitors come to my site?</strong>
        <br>
        Visitors will come to this website instead of others as it has a multitiude of content. Not only does it have information on popular groups but it also will explain commonly used terms and how kpop began. It removes the need for someone to go to multiple websites just to understand the one discussing different groups.<br>

        <strong> A snippet of what information about a group will look like: </strong> <br>
