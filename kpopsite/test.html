        <strong>What type of activities can visitors complete?</strong>
    <br>
    In terms of activities, people come mainly for information as it is a database of sorts. However, I will include a "if you like this group you might also like_" feature. To help people learn about other groups and to relate kpop back to english and americanized songs.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>What information is necessary?</strong>
    <br>
    For one, basic information and understanding towards kpop is required, I would need to know enough information about it to teach others. However, as a visitor there is no level of knowledge needed. As I mentioned before, the site is made with beginners in mind.<br>
<br>
    <strong>Why will visitors come to my site?</strong>
    <br>
    Visitors will come to this website instead of others as it has a multitiude of content. Not only does it have information on popular groups but it also will explain commonly used terms and how kpop began. It removes the need for someone to go to multiple websites just to understand the one discussing different groups.<br>
